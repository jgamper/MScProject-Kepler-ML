## Machine Learning for Exo-Planet detection

This repository contains code developed for MSc research project at Warwick University [Mathematics of Systems CDT](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/mathsys/) under the title 
of "Machine Learning for Exoplanet Detection". (**On going project**)

##### Supervised by:

    Dr. David Armstrong (Astrophysics, Warwick University)
    Dr. Theo Damoulas   (Computer Science, Warwick University)
    
##### Background:

    A key method for the detection of new planets outside our Solar
    System is searching for transits, eclipses as the planet blocks some of the light from
    its parent star. Satellites such as NASAâ€™s Kepler monitor hundreds of thousands of
    stars for extended periods, measuring their brightness over time. Finding transits in
    this data is complex, and involves significant human input. Real planets are
    obscured by false positives, signals which can mimic a planet but in fact arise from
    other sources. Here we use available data from the Kepler satellite, which
    contains 2300 known planets, 2300 known false positives, and 1800 candidate
    signals containing among them as yet unknown planets. 

##### Methods used:

    Will be added soon..
    
    
##### Description of the files in the repository (**On going project**):

    randomforestpaper.py - contains python implementation of the methods from "Automatic Classification of Kepler Planetary Transit Candidates" (McCaulliff et. al. 2015).

    modelspipeline.py - contains python implementation of a class to optimize many ML models using GridSearchCV, save results, confusion matrices, models.
